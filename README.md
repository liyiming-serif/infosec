# infosec

Erik's notes 6/28:

RHS arg select interface must work
number line bleeds into the LHS
put it online
proofread
set up tutorial
level select as tabs
highlight stop button: let player know that player can exit run mode
debug tutorial
level complete screen
make obvious 'take' is from player's wire

social engineering?

computer security puzzles
-ownership accepts everything
-brute forcing password
-resetting someone else's password
-information flow/leakage
-memory access pattern vulnerability

player observes people requesting password reset (by providing email or other personal information)
treat personal information like a dossier and use them to hack their password
*teach player how password authentication and mechanisms work
