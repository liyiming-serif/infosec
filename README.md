# infosec

Erik's notes 6/28:

RHS arg select interface must work

number line bleeds into the LHS

highlight stop button: let player know that player can exit run mode

step back and step forward icon redesign

proofread

level select as tabs

put it online



debug tutorial

level complete screen

make obvious 'take' is from player's wire



social engineering?

computer security puzzles:

-ownership accepts everything

-brute forcing password

-resetting someone else's password

-information flow/leakage

-memory access pattern vulnerability

Player observes people requesting password reset (by providing email or other personal information). Treat personal information like a dossier and use them to hack their password. VISION: Teach player how password authentication and mechanisms work.
